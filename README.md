# email_project

The end goal of this project is to have code that will import excel file with test grade, run the file, then send an auto email to the email listed for the guardian of the child that took the test stating the grade. Eventually I would like for it to have a good/bad email seperator. The end goal of it all is to also then create a list of phone numbers for students who failed but do not have a listed email. I am just beginning this, lots of work left.
